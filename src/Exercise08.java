/*
Mastering Abstraction in Java: Interfaces and Abstract Classes in Java
Create a Java program that models real-world machines using abstraction principles.

Your task is to:

Create an interface called Machine with one method:

String start();


Create an abstract class called Appliance that:

Implements Machine

Has a String name field

Has a constructor to set the name

Create two concrete classes:

Fan, which extends Appliance and overrides start() to return "Fan is running"

WashingMachine, which extends Appliance and overrides start() to return "Washing Machine is operating"

In the main() method:

Create one object of each type using the interface reference:

Machine fan = new Fan("Fan");
Machine washer = new WashingMachine("Washing Machine");
Call start() on each and print the result.


Instructions:

Use an interface to define behavior (start() method).

Use an abstract class to provide common structure (the name field).

Use subclasses to implement and customize behavior.

Use System.out.println() to print outputs as shown below.

Expected Output

  Fan is running

  Washing Machine is operating
*/

interface Machine {
    String start();
}

abstract class Appliance implements Machine {
    String name;

    public Appliance(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class Fan extends Appliance {
    @Override
    public String start() {
        return "Fan is running";
    }

    public Fan(String name) {
        super(name);
    }
}

class WashingMachine extends Appliance {
    @Override
    public String start() {
        return "Washing Machine is operating";
    }

    public WashingMachine(String name) {
       super(name);
    }
}

public class Exercise08 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Machine fan = new Fan("Fan");
        Machine washer = new WashingMachine("Washing Machine");

        System.out.println(fan.start());
        System.out.println(washer.start());
    }
}
